# Anatolia Bibliography Map of Archaeology

The goal of this project is to spatially locate bibliographic resources (published articles, books) regarding the archaeology of Anatolia (modern Turkey).  This takes the bibliography of archaeology to the next level by showing not only the topics and authors, but where the archaeological research is being done.

*Note:* This web app was initially developed as a class project in Fall 2016 for CIS557: Programming for the Web at the University of Pennslyvania (Instructor: Swapneel Sheth).  The original app team can be seen under contributors.  Development will continue with other partners.
